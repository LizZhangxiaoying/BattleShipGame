Question 1.
    Ships will always be facing up or to the left. That is, relative to the “bow”, or front,
    of the ship, all other tiles will be in higher numbered rows or columns. ?

Question 2.
    the 2D array is made up by type Ship
        1. first it was filled with empty sea
        2. then it can be filled with ships
        3. Ship[10][10] ships = new EmptySea();

            are they all different object instances?

            ships[1][1]= new Destroyer();
            Ship[0][1] ships = new Destroyer();
            Ship[0][2] ships = new Destroyer();
            Ship[0][3] ships = new Destroyer();


   printf (%c,  ships[1][2].getStatus


   ships[1][2] = ship[1][3]
